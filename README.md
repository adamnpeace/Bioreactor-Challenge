# Chemical Reactor Project

### UCL Integrated Engineering Program (Challenge 2)

This task involved working in inter-disciplinary teams to design and prototype certain technical aspects of a new Tuberculosis (TB) vaccine production facility in Uganda, Sub-Saharan Africa.



#### Bioreactor Specification

•Inlet water temperature 10-20°C

•Maintain the temperature at a set point in the range 25-35°C to ±0.5°C

•Stirring speed range 500-1500 RPM

•Maintain stirring speed to ±20 RPM

•pH sensing range 3 - 8

•Maintain pH at optimum 5

All sensors should log data and provide a user interface for monitoring and set-point adjustment.
